# Boston-Housing-Market-Regression-Project
This project was to predict the housing prices of a town or suburb based on the features of the locality provided. 




In the process, we need to identify the most important features affecting the price of the house. We need to employ techniques of data preprocessing and build a linear regression model that predicts the prices for the unseen data.

Step by step process
To start we did exploratory data analysis and some visual analysis on our data. Our univariate analysis showed the skewness of our data and our bivariate analysis showed us the correlation between different variables.
After looking at multicollinearity we dropped the TAX colum and went on to look at linear regression.
After examining our model summary we dropped the insignificant variables whose p value was <.05
We discovered that our residuals were homoscedastic and then went on to check the linearity of our variables.
We then checked the performance of our model using various evaluation metrics including cross validation.
We then finalized our regression equation
